    "Knowledge-based filtering is a recommendation technique that uses **explicit knowledge** about user requirements and item attributes to generate recommendations. Unlike collaborative filtering (which relies on user behavior patterns) or content-based filtering (which relies on item similarity), knowledge-based systems engage in a **dialogue with the user** to precisely determine their preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Principle:\n",
    "*\"The system helps users find items by understanding their explicit requirements and constraints, without needing historical interaction data.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works:\n",
    "1. **Elicit User Requirements**: Gather explicit preferences through dialogue or forms\n",
    "2. **Apply Knowledge Rules**: Use domain knowledge to filter or rank items\n",
    "3. **Generate Recommendations**: Present items that satisfy user requirements\n",
    "4. **Refine Through Feedback**: Allow users to critique and refine recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Knowledge-Based Filtering:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Constraint-Based (Preference-Based)**\n",
    "- User specifies **hard constraints** (requirements that must be satisfied)\n",
    "- System filters items to find those matching all constraints\n",
    "- Example: \"Find action movies from the 1990s with rating > 7.0\"\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../images/kb_constraints_architecture.png\" alt=\"Constraint-Based Filtering Architecture\" width=\"1200\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Case-Based Reasoning (CBR)**\n",
    "- User provides a **reference case** (example item they like)\n",
    "- System finds similar items and allows **critiquing**\n",
    "- User can iteratively refine by excluding unwanted features\n",
    "- Example: \"Find movies like 'Finding Nemo' but not animated\"\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../images/kb_case_architecture.png\" alt=\"Case-Based Filtering Architecture\" width=\"1200\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages:\n",
    "- ✅ **No Cold Start Problem**: Works immediately with new users and items\n",
    "- ✅ **Transparency**: Clear explanation of why items are recommended\n",
    "- ✅ **Precision**: Exact matching of user requirements\n",
    "- ✅ **No Gray Sheep Problem**: Works for users with unique tastes\n",
    "- ✅ **Domain Expertise**: Leverages expert knowledge about the domain\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages:\n",
    "- ❌ **User Effort Required**: Users must explicitly specify preferences\n",
    "- ❌ **Limited Serendipity**: Unlikely to discover unexpected items\n",
    "- ❌ **Knowledge Engineering**: Requires domain expertise to build\n",
    "- ❌ **Scalability**: Can be computationally expensive with many constraints\n",
    "- ❌ **No Learning**: Doesn't automatically adapt to user behavior\n",

    "### Theory and Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraint-based filtering works by applying a set of **hard constraints** (requirements) to filter the item catalog. Each constraint eliminates items that don't satisfy the requirement, resulting in a set of items that match **all** specified criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Formulation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let:\n",
    "- $I$ = set of all items (movies)\n",
    "- $C = \\{c_1, c_2, ..., c_n\\}$ = set of constraints\n",
    "- $c_i(item)$ = boolean function returning true if item satisfies constraint $i$\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommendation set $R$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R = \\{item \\in I \\mid \\forall c_i \\in C: c_i(item) = true\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraint Types**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Range Constraints**: $min \\leq attribute \\leq max$\n",
    "   - Example: $6.0 \\leq vote\\_average \\leq 10.0$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Categorical Constraints**: $attribute \\in \\{value_1, value_2, ...\\}$\n",
    "   - Example: $genre \\in \\{Action, Adventure\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **String Matching**: $pattern \\subseteq attribute$\n",
    "   - Example: $\"star\" \\subseteq title$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Temporal Constraints**: $date_1 \\leq release\\_date \\leq date_2$\n",
    "   - Example: $1980 \\leq year \\leq 1998$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Available Constraints\n",

    "The following table shows the constraints available in our TMDB-based system:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Constraint | Application |\n",
    "|------------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Minimum Average Rating** | Filter movies based on user ratings |\n",
    "| **Minimum Vote Count** | Find more or less popular movies |\n",
    "| **Release Date Range** | Find movies released in a specific time period |\n",
    "| **Minimum Revenue** | Find commercially successful movies |\n",
    "| **Runtime Range** | Find movies of specific length |\n",
    "| **Minimum Budget** | Filter low-budget or high-budget movies |\n",
    "| **Original Language** | Find movies in a specific language |\n",
    "| **Genres** | Find movies of specific genres |\n",
    "| **Production Countries** | Find movies produced in specific countries |\n",

    "### Theory and Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Case-Based Reasoning is an advanced recommendation method where users can **interactively refine** their recommendation list. Unlike traditional content-based or collaborative filtering systems that work statically, case-based systems allow **dynamic modification** of results through critiquing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Select Reference Case**: User chooses a specific movie as a reference point\n",
    "2. **Find Similar Cases**: System identifies movies with similar features using similarity metrics\n",
    "3. **Present Recommendations**: Show top-N most similar movies\n",
    "4. **Critique and Refine**: User provides feedback on unwanted features\n",
    "5. **Iterate**: System excludes movies with critiqued features and finds new recommendations\n",
    "6. **Converge**: Process continues until user is satisfied\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Formulation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let:\n",
    "- $C$ = reference case (movie)\n",
    "- $I$ = set of all items (movies)\n",
    "- $sim(C, i)$ = similarity between reference case and item $i$\n",
    "- $E$ = set of excluded features (from critiques)\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_0 = \\{i \\in I \\mid i \\neq C\\}, \\text{ ranked by } sim(C, i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "After critiquing iteration $k$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_k = \\{i \\in R_{k-1} \\mid \\forall e \\in E: e \\notin features(i)\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Similarity Computation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "We use **TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity** (same as content-based filtering):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Extraction**: Combine genres, keywords, production companies, overview into metadata string\n",
    "2. **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Convert metadata to numerical vectors\n",
    "3. **Cosine Similarity**: Calculate similarity between all movie pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "$$sim(i, j) = \\frac{\\vec{v}_i \\cdot \\vec{v}_j}{\\|\\vec{v}_i\\| \\times \\|\\vec{v}_j\\|}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\vec{v}_i$ and $\\vec{v}_j$ are TF-IDF vectors for movies $i$ and $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critiquing Mechanism**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can critique recommendations by specifying unwanted features:\n",
    "- **Genre Critique**: \"No Animation\"\n",
    "- **Keyword Critique**: \"No Romance\"\n",
    "- **Production Company Critique**: \"No Disney\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The system then:\n",
    "1. Excludes all movies containing the critiqued feature\n",
    "2. Finds new similar movies from remaining candidates\n",
    "3. Ensures recommendations list is replenished (e.g., to 20 movies)\n",

    "In practice, the most effective knowledge-based systems combine both approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start with Constraints**: Apply basic filters (language, rating, date range)\n",
    "2. **Use Case-Based Refinement**: Find similar items within filtered set\n",

    "4. **Iterate**: Refine until user is satisfied\n",

    "```\n",
    "User: \"Find action movies from 2010-2020 with rating > 7.0\" (Constraint-Based)\n",
    "System: Returns 500 movies\n",
    "User: \"Show me movies like Inception from this set\" (Case-Based)\n",
    "System: Returns 20 similar movies\n",
    "User: \"No sci-fi\" (Critique)\n",
